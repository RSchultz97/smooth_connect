**Using threads to better organize text communication by semantics and time**

People text message a lot these days. For most people it’s their preferred mode of communication. Yet it's not perfect. Not even close.

Text communication has always been organized only by time and in a single thread. This approach is sufficient for simple 1 on 1 conversations but breaks down in 2 common scenarios:
- 1 on 1 conversation with multiple topics/threads (requires one to convert the time organization to semantic organization)
    - Not effective or fun, requires effort
    - Can lead to mistakes (someone forgets to respond to something or someone starts to respond before you are finished)
- Large group conversations. Same multiple topics/threads problem
    - 2 different subgroups can’t converse at the same time in the same group chat
    - Very confusing, and not effective at all.

Smooth Connect offers a solution to this problem by building a framework that enables multiple "threads" to organically occur during a text conversation. Allowing to better organize semantics, and helping to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Things start simple, and threads are only spawned when required.

With this framework, I believe you could implement a Natural Language processing API that could allow the threads to dynamically spawn and close off. This dynamic spawn/close is the ultimate solution.
